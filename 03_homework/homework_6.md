**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Having been in the applications development world for a decade and a half now, I see that the regulations around data are becoming more and more stringent today. There weren’t many regulations or comprehensive laws in place then. Applications often collected more data than necessary, with less transparency and fewer user controls over what data was collected and how it was used. 

With the advancement of AI and Data science technologies that are built predominantly around data and computers being trained to perform predictive analytics based on it, the potential for misuse of data is considerably more now. It takes accountability from everyone to have compliance in place more than ever. Ethical considerations around user data and consent are beginning to gain traction. It becomes the developer’s responsibility to address this from the very roots that is the structural design of data and the data management practises.

Below are some of the suggestions to address the Ethics and inequality issues in data
-	To modify existing user profile tables to include fields for demographic information (e.g. gender, race, age, disability status) with ability to include new categorizations. 
-	Ensure this data collection complies with privacy regulations and is done transparently. Provide users with information on what data is collected and on how it is being used. 
-	Track changes to sensitive data, along with who made the change and why. Implement robust access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. 
-	To have feedback mechanisms for users to report ethical concerns or inequities they experience. Log ethical issues that are raised, including date, description, have it resolved and mark a resolution status. 
-	Only collect data that is necessary for the analysis of ethics and inequity. Avoid collecting excessive or sensitive information unless absolutely necessary and justified. 
-	Conduct regular audits of the data and the database to ensure compliance with ethical standards and privacy laws.
